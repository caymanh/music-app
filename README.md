 ### Description

 Music App is a React-based music application that utilizes React lifecycle methods to query and play songs based on user searches. The app has four pages - Discover, Around You, Top Artists, and Top Charts.

 The Discover page enables users to toggle between different music genre and discover new songs.
 
 The Around You page shows users popular songs in their geolocations.
 
 The Top Artists page displayes popular artists.

 Users are also able to search for artists and songs using the search bar, as well as use the application as a music player to listen to their favorite songs.

 The app utilizes the Shazam Core and ipify APIs to obtain music data and identify the user's geolocation.
